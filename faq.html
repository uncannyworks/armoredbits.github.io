      <div class="question-block">
        <div class="question-q">Q. What is Armored Bits?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. Armored Bits is a programmable online multiplayer robot battle simulator.  Players program the logic to drive their robot, including things like configuring it pre-match, communicating with teammates via player-defined protocols, and optimally finding, locking onto, and destroying their enemies.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. Who is Uncanny Works?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. We a small two man independent game development team outside of Osaka, Japan.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. What programming languages will I be able to program in?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. Hopefully any language you possibly could!</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. I've never programmed before.  Will there be tutorials?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. One of our primary goals is to help people new to programming learn everything they need to know in order to play our game.  Not only do we plan on writing first class documentation, but we'd like to include as many tutorials and guides as possible for as many languages as we can.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. How will you stop people from cheating?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. Player code will be executed inside CPU and memory constrained containers on our own server infrastructure.  Outside world communication will be disabled.  These containers (called <em>Slugs</em>) only allow communication with the core game server running the game instance itself.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. How many players in the same game?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. Currently we plan on trying 5v5 battles to see how it goes.  We could very easily increase or decrease this number over time.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. Which game modes will be available?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. The first official game mode will be Team Deathmatch.  Future versions will include Capture the Objective, Defend & Destroy, Deahtmatch, Arena, Duels, and whatever else we dream of.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. What kind of ranked play system will be in place?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. Assuming we attract a large enough player base, we'd really like to put an ELO-like ranking system in place for people interested in doing ranked competitive play.  Players would then compete for places in standard ladder style leagues, such as Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. Will there be clans/teams?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. We would definitely like to allow players to create their own teams.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. What does the game client let me do?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. Initially the client will strictly be a game viewer so players can watch their matches in realtime.  We would also like to add a robot customization tester, a local game simulator for sandbox testing, and community features such as chat and forums.</div>
        <div class="question-q">Q. Potential recruitment?</div>
        <div class="question-a blurb">A. We would really like to use this platform to help people gain recognition and employment.  We see this not only as a game to be played, but as a way for people to prove that they have the coding chops it takes to write high level code.</div>
