        <h3>A Programmable Multiplayer Mech Simulator</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Armored Bits is staged in a futuristic Earth where team based combat occurs between artificial intelligence driven mechs. Combat is incredibly visceral and brutal, where nanosecond decisions are the difference between victory or defeat.
        <ep>
        <p class="blurb">
            One of our major inspirations was from the novel <em>A.I. Apocalypse</em>, book 2 of the Singularity series by William Hertling.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Two years later the Mech War gaming platform was introduced just prior to the Christmas season. It became the must-have game. The old standby worlds went vacant, their online environments quickly becoming ghost towns. Mech War became not just the best massively multiplayer online game, it quickly became the only game left standing."
        <blockquote>
        </blockquote>
            "Where other games had elaborate anti-cheat mechanisms to prevent people from using aimbots, Mech War provided plugin APIs for games to develop aiming algorithms. Where other games had server side monitoring to ensure gamers didnâ€™t flit about the environment, Mech war provided a realistic physics model of the universe and a moving-parts-level simulation of in-game equipment."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="blurb">
            We are also heavily inspired by classics such as <strong>Mechwarrior 2</strong>, <strong>Earthsiege / Starsiege</strong>, and the numerous other mech games since. We wanted to take simulation to the next level by removing the player element and replacing it with algorithms they've designed themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            While we greatly respect the skills and reflexes it takes to be competitive in most games, we also believe that another solid and under-represented way to compete against other players in the video game industry is with the intellect. Targeted at both advanced and novice programmers alike, we want to give players the tools to coordinate with teammates and crush their enemies using advanced algorithms and programming techniques.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
          The game is being developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mojobojo">Brian Jones</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cerbermus">Chris Johnston</a> under the <a href="http://uncannyworks.com/">Uncanny Works</a> flag. Upon release the game will be freely available and playable through our game service, however, to help with development costs we are currently accepting payments from interested backers in return for various rewards.
        </p>
        <h3>It's All About the Mechs</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Our goal is to <strong>give players as many options as possible</strong> so that they have a large number of choices with which to do combat while coordinating with teammates. Right now mechs can be programmatically configured using various components ranging from different chassis, weapons, sensors, computers, and counter measures, to various ammo loadouts, communication devices, and more. As time goes on we want to add more and more features, making for richer and engaging combat situations.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            The large variety of components will give players the ability to mix and match to suit their tastes. Want a Command & Control robot? No problem, pick a cockpit and reactor which can handle a large number of sensors, computers, and communication devices. Want to go large and in-your-face stompy mech bristling with weapons? We've got that too. Each mech has various pluggable hardpoints which can connect up with a myriad of components built by various manufacturers. Will you sacrifice speed for firepower, ammo space for beam weapons and capacitors, or aim for the best balance possible?
        </p>
        <h3>Ranked Multiplayer Team Combat</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            <strong>Armored Bits is strictly an online multiplayer game.</strong> Players will have the opportunity to build teams, play in ranked games, and climb through the league system to prove that they can write the best artificial intelligence code possible. Seasons will remain short (roughly 3-4 per year), and top teams/players will gain recognition for their programming prowess. As the community grows we may even host tournaments with prizes!
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            In order to keep the scene regulated, player code will execute on our internal infrastructure inside CPU and memory constrained containers we call <strong>Slugs</strong>. While it would be absolutely amazing to see what some high level AI code hooked up to a supercomputer might look like, for the sake of maintaining a controlled competitive environment we cannot allow any kind of remote code execution or communication.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            <strong>However</strong>, players will be able to connect to the running game match via a 3d game client and watch the battle unfold in realtime! How cool is that?
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Language of Choice</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Do you prefer C? Are you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> masochist? Maybe a dynamic language like Lua is your thing? Or are you a novice that needs a little guidance towards how to get started programming?
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            Our game API uses Google Protocol Buffers and communicates over TCP. Almost any language available should be able to run against our game servers, and we'll do everything we can to help make sure our Slugs support them all.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            The first two official SDKs we will be releasing are written in JavaScript and Haskell. The first because it's a widely used and fairly well documented language which is easy for people to get started with. The second because the core game server has been written in it which provides a lot of existing boiler plate the client SDK can leverage.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            We'd definitely like to help the community implement new SDKs in their favorite programming language of choice. Giving everyone a chance to experiment with languages they may have never otherwise touched can be quite the learning experience!
        </p>
        <h3>Official Unity3d Client</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Our game client (match viewer) is written using Unity3d, however, we will also be publishing the specificiations for how it interacts with our service should people be interested in writing unofficial clients. This is a programming game afterall, and creating as many opportunities for the community to explore seems like a powerful thing to us!
        </p>
        <h3>Recruitment</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            We're attempting to organize a large community of programmers which have the ability to use whichever language they please and competitively climb a ranked ladder system to prove that they are the best. What better way to find your next employee, or prove to your new employer that you have advanced coding chops?
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            We hope that Armored Bits can prove to be a valuable recruitment tool. While it may not cover every aspect of an IT job, it definitely is a good way to showcase your algorithms and application design should you be willing to share your code.
        </p>

        <h3>About the Backing Tiers</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            For the record the final game will be free to play with micro-transactions for in-game cosmetic enhancements to mechs and the environment. By backing us you help guarantee that we can bring this game one step closer to release. We sincerely appreciate your consideration should you choose to back us.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            We are currently a two man studio working on this project with as much vigor as we can muster. A few bucks here and there would go a long way towards helping us with our caffeine fueled indie dev coding sprints. More importantly, three of the primary places we will be utilizing backer money are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="blurb">A 3d artist or two to help provide us with detailed mechs and environments which go beyond the nice-but-limited placeholder art we've purchased.</li>
            <li class="blurb">A 2d artist to help us make beautiful UIs for our visual game client and web services.</li>
            <li class="blurb"><a href="http://systemcrashaudio.com">Our audio engineer buddy</a> who has time and again made some of the most amazing sounds and background music for our previous projects.</li>
            <li class="blurb">The server infrastructure required to run and support the whole game service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="blurb">
            Each tier basically corresponds with when you'll have a chance to get a sneak peek at the game.
        </p>
        <h4>Alpha Tests</h4>
        <p class="blurb">
            Internal alpha tests are when we turn on a server, and everyone manually connects their SDK and visual clients up to see how things go. These tests can be incredibly buggy, broken, and definitely frustrating. The API is still changing as we add more features to the server, and SDKs aren't stable as they try to keep up with the changes. You may want to avoid this tier if you prefer consistency and stability. Alternatively, <strong>this could be a good chance to become a forerunner and develop a community SDK in a language that interests you.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            We will run the weekend alpha tests when we have a little more confidence that our code is functional, somewhat stable, and won't break. These are limited events which are focused on getting a decent number of people playing the game simultaneously in a controlled environment. We still haven't settled on the maximum team sizes, so you could see games ranging from 5v5 to 25v25 as we continue to experiment.
        </p>
        <h4>Beta Test</h4>
        <p class="blurb">
            The closed beta test event will occur when we're sure the game server API and SDKs are solid, and we've got the core game service components in place (login server, match making server, Slug coordination, etc.). The goal will be to stress test the system and find any remaining bugs in the entire stack.
        </p>
        <h4>Chat Server</h4>
        <p class="blurb">
            People who sign up for the alpha test tier levels will be able to join our private Slack chat. We'd be happy to hear your thoughts, feedback, and generally hangout and shoot the breeze with you.
        </p>
        <h4>Schedule</h4>
        <p class="blurb">
            We are reluctant to adhere to any specific schedule. However, we'd like to start alpha testing by the summer of 2016, and beta testing by winter. <strong>This is currently arbitrary and subject to change!</strong>
