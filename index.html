        <h3>A Programmable Mech Simulator</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Armored Bits is staged on a futuristic Earth where team based combat occurs between artificial intelligence driven mechs.  Inspired by classics such as <strong>Mechwarrior 2</strong>, <strong>Earthsiege / Starsiege</strong>, and the numerous other mech games since, we wanted to take simulation to the next level by removing the player element and replacing them with algorithms they've designed themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            While we greatly respect the skills and reflexes it takes to be competitive in most games, we also believe that another solid and under-represented way to compete against other players is with the intellect. Targeted at both advanced and novice programmers alike, we want to give players the tools to coordinate with teammates and crush their enemies using advanced algorithms and programming techniques alone.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
          The game is being developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mojobojo">Brian Jones</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cerbermus">Chris Johnston</a> under the <a href="http://uncannyworks.com/">Uncanny Works</a> flag. Upon release the game will be freely available and playable through our game service, however, to help with development we are currently accepting payments from interested backers in return for various rewards.
        </p>
        <h3>It's All About the Mechs</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Our goal is to <strong>give players as much as possible to work with.</strong> Right now mechs can be configured using various components ranging from different chassis, weapons, sensors, computers, counter measures, to various ammo loadouts, communication devices, and more. As time goes on we want to add more and more features, making for richer and engaging combat situations.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            The large variety of components will give players the ability to mix and match to suit their tastes. Want a Command & Control robot? No problem, pick a cockpit and reactor which can handle a large number of sensors, computers, and communication devices. Want to go large and in-your-face stompy? We've got that too. Each mech has various pluggable hardpoints which can connect up with a myriad of components built by various manufacturers.
        </p>
        <h3>Ranked Multiplayer Team Combat</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            <strong>Armored Bits is strictly an online game.</strong> Players will have the opportunity to build teams, play in ranked games, and climb through the league system to prove that they can write the best artificial intelligence code possible. Seasons will remain short (roughly 3-4 per year), and top teams/players will gain recognition for their programming prowess. As the community grows we may even host tournaments with prizes!
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            In order to keep the scene regulated player code will execute on our internal infrastructure inside CPU and memory constrained containers we call <strong>Slugs</strong>. While it would be absolutely amazing to see what some high level AI code hooked up to a supercomputer might look like, for the sake of maintaining a controlled competitive environment we cannot allow any kind of remote code execution or communication.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            <strong>However</strong>, players will be able to connect to the running game match via a 3d game client and watch the battle unfold in realtime! How cool is that?
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Language of Choice</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Our game API uses Google Protocol Buffers which communicate over TCP. Almost any language available should be able to run against our game servers, and we'll do everything we can to help make sure our Slugs support them all.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            The first two official SDKs we will be releasing are written in JavaScript and Haskell. The first because it's a widely used and fairly well documented language which is easy for people to get started with. The second because the core game server has been written in it which provides a lot of existing boiler plate the client SDK can leverage.
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
            Our hope is that the community dives in and implements new SDKs in their favorite programming language of choice, giving everyone a chance to experiment with languages they may have never otherwise touched.
        </p>
        <h3>Official Unity3d Client</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            Our game client (match viewer) is written using Unity3d, however, we will also be publishing the specificiations for how it interacts with our service should people be interested in writing unofficial clients. This is a programming game afterall, and creating as many opportunities for the community to explore seems like a powerful thing to us!
        </p>
        <h3>Recruitment</h3>
        <p class="blurb">
            We're attempting to organize a large community of programmers which have the ability to use whichever language they please, and competitively climb a ranked ladder system to prove that they are the best. What better way to find your next employee, or prove to your new employer that you have advanced coding chops?
        </p>
